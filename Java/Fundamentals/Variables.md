`Java variables are essentially containers for storing data values. They can hold different types of data, such as integers, characters, or floating-point numbers. Here's a quick rundown:`

1. `**Primitive Data Types**: These are the most basic data types available in Java.`
    
    - `int: Stores integers (whole numbers) without decimals, such as 123 or -456.`
        
    - `float: Stores fractional numbers, containing one or more decimals. Example: 3.14.`
        
    - `char: Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values. Example: 'A', 'b'.`
        
    - `boolean: Stores values with two states: true or false.`
        
2. `**Non-Primitive Data Types**: These are also known as reference types because they refer to objects.`
    
    - `String: Stores text. Example: "Hello, World!".`
        
    - `Array: Stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. Example: int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};`
